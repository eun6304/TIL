# TIL (Today I Learned)
Welcome to my TIL (Today I Learned) repository! This is a personal record of my daily learning journey, where I capture new concepts, techniques, and insights across various topics. Each day is a step forward in expanding my knowledge and skills.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by topics, each represented by a separate directory. Each directory contains markdown files or other resources related to that specific subject. This structure helps in easy navigation and reference.

## Commit Message Guidelines
Commit messages are straightforward to distinguish between new content and updates:

* **write**: Used when adding a completely new document or topic.
* **update**: Used when making changes, improvements, or refinements to an existing document.

## Topics
You'll find directories on different topics, each containing:

* **Subject-specific notes** on what I learned.
* **Practical examples and code snippets** (when applicable).
* **References** for further study or insights.

Feel free to explore and learn along with me!

## Why TIL?
Maintaining this repository is not only a great way for me to retain what I've learned but also serves as a quick reference and as a resource that others might find helpful.
